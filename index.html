    <summary>What is my dream?</summary>
    <p>
     My biggest dream right now is to become an AI Engineer.
     That’s why I’m currently focusing on mastering Python.
     I believe that nothing is impossible as long as we keep trying, and that hard work never betrays the results.
     So whatever your dream is right now, keep working toward it — even if you think it’s too far out of reach :)

    <summary>What does success mean to me?</summary>
    <p>
     My mom has always told me since I was little, <i>“You have to be able to earn your own money.”</i>
     That mindset has been ingrained in me ever since.
     In this one life I have, I want to become the person I dreamed of as a child — someone cool, with a luxurious house, a fancy car, and all that.
     
     But to me, the essence of success isn’t just about having a big house or an expensive car.
     It’s about reaching true peace and freedom.
     
     So, what’s the definition of freedom?
     It’s when you can sleep peacefully, eat your favorite food, laugh with your family, and enjoy your hobbies without any pressure or overthinking.

    <summary>Things I love (besides coding)</summary>

        <span class=art">
        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
        For me, art is therapy. I love paintings. My favorite painters are Vincent Van Gogh
        and Claude Monet. And... yeah, I love impressionist paintings. A painting is not
        judged by how realistic it is — I think art is more than that. Painting is an
        expression of the soul. Each painting has its own "feel".
        <br>
        I also have an artistic side. In my free time, I
        usually draw characters that I like, or just random drawings.
        <br>
        Fun fact: I like drawing, but I don't like coloring.
        <br><br>
        Wanna see my drawings?

        <span class="music">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
        My music taste revolves around artists with a strong and distinctive vibe. I’m drawn
        to dark Alt-R&B (like The Weeknd, Brent Faiyaz, Clara La San) and moody electronic
        sounds such as Dream Pop and Synthwave (Grimes, Pastel Ghost). I love music that feels
        emotional and unique — from the soulful melancholy of Daniel Caesar, Avenoir, Montell
        Fish to the smooth, timeless jazz of Sade. I also enjoy classical pieces like Chopin’s
        <em>Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2</em> and Debussy’s <em>Clair de Lune</em>.
        <br><br>
        There are still MANY of my favorite songs and singers, you can see them on my Spotify account.
